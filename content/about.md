My name is Thomas Lam. I'm a software engineer working at [Capital One](https://github.com/capitalone) based in McLean, VA.

I'm interested in all things data science or machine learning related (and developing software in general). This website is meant to capture my journey on being a bit more knowledgeable about this vast and fascinating field.

Occasionally here you'll find my collections/ramblings on books/articles/media I've consumed and other general non-technical stuff.

Feel free to reach out at <tuananhlam95@gmail.com> for inquiries.
