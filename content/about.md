My name is Thomas Lam. I'm a (prospective) data engineer working at [Capital One](https://github.com/capitalone) based in DC. 

I'm interested in all things data science or machine learning related (and developing software in general). This website is meant to capture my journey on being a bit more knowledgeable about this vast and fascinating field. 

Occasionally here you'll find my ramblings on life, books I've read and general non-technical stuff.

Feel free to reach out at <tuananhlam95@gmail.com> for inquiries, resume requests, etc. Other ways you can reach me: [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomaslam95/), [github](https://github.com/thomaslam)
