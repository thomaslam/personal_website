_*Week 04/15 - 04/21*_

This is the first post of my weekly blog series on interesting things I've read/listened. I also try to keep myself accountable in terms of self education by including the __What I am working on__ section at the end.

# News
* [Notre Dame fire](https://www.cbsnews.com/live-news/notre-dame-cathedral-fire-dozens-investigating-notre-dame-fire-cause-today-2019-04-17-live-updates/)

  * AY background: running for 2020 presidential election as a Dem.; has startup experience (founded VFA - incentize young college graduates to move to emerging cities besides usual millenial hubs)
  * Center to his platform: claims UBI ($1000 for every >18 US citizen) to be solution to automation
  * Thoughts: 
    * profile of a stereotypically successful Asian in America (Philip Exeter, Brown, Columbia Law) but pretty unusual for a presidential candidate - a huge plus for Asian representation
    * curious to see what his voter demographic will mostly comprise of - my guess: technophiles; Asian Americans dying for polical representation; Reddit, 4chan trolls - the alt-right crowd (would be interesting to see how interactions between these groups play out)
  * Related: he's appeared on Joe Rogan's podcast (2 hrs) - [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTsEzmFamZ8); also CNN's coverage of him is atrocious - [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Q6sDKvwdO0); will add his book to reading list: [War on normal people](https://www.amazon.com/War-Normal-People-Disappearing-Universal/dp/0316414247)

# ML/Data Science
* [Data Skeptic: word2vec](https://dataskeptic.com/blog/episodes/2019/word2vec)
  * What it is: a neural network model that guesses a hidden word based on context (words appearing before and after); takes as input large text corpus and produces vector space where each unique word in corpus is assigned a vector in space
  * Foundational NLP technique, used by big tech companies for various NLP-related products
  * __Note-to-self__: write an in-depth blog post
