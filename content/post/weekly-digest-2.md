  * [CRISPR/Cas9](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pp17E4E-O8) - technology used to create these babies (more layperson friendly video in this [article](https://www.statnews.com/2018/11/25/china-first-gene-edited-babies-born/))

# Big ideas
* [Belief in meritocracy is bad for you](https://aeon.co/ideas/a-belief-in-meritocracy-is-not-only-false-its-bad-for-you)
    * "believing in meritocracy makes people more selfish, less self-critical and even more prone to acting in discriminatory ways"
    * "in companies that explicitly held meritocracy as a core value, managers assigned greater rewards to male employees over female employees with identical performance evaluations. This preference disappeared where meritocracy was not explicitly adopted as a value"

    * troubling consequences of one type of recomm. algo: showing items people "like" you have read/watched/shopped - perpetuate stereotypes (e.g. show boys coding books, girls fashion magazines)
    * interesting example of how ppl exploit trending algo on big social media platform: democracy activists during Arab Spring use new hashtags in coordination so their discussion can trend on Twitter
