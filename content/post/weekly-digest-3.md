# Big ideas
* [Don't try to be an influencer. Try to be a nerd instead](https://chibicode.com/posts/don-t-try-to-be-an-influencer-try-to-be-a-nerd-instead-don-t-try-to-maximize-your-impact-try-to-maximize-your-interest-instead/)
    * [Being a nerd pays off](https://twitter.com/codinghorror/status/852311991981035520/)
    * Being an influencer is a bad metric for self-worth; some people will never capture another people's needs or attention; being a nerd is always a winning strategy

* [Difference between workaholics and high performers](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20140625132650-4398055-high-performers-vs-workaholics-7-subtle-differences/)
    * Basically
        * **A high performer works hard in healthy sustainable ways and feels happy and inspired.**
        * **A workaholic works hard in unhealthy unsustainable ways and feels unhappy and burned out.**
    * In order to be a high performer
        * Focus on doing business (i.e. perform actions driven by results e.g. create tangible/relevant goals, form strategies/plans, follow through) as opposed to filling up time with busy work (i.e. reading/responding to emails right away instead of batching this appropriately)
        * Have a clear definition of success (seek to improve in areas that matter but know when to stop being a perfectionist)
        * Create own feedback loop instead of relying on external validation from boss, coworkers and clients
        * Be proactive/intentional with time and work (2-3 hours of deep undistracted work - no social media, preferably no disruptive emails/phone calls/meetings)
        * Focus on effort, compare against their best self instead of focusing on income/outcome and comparison against others

* [Ryan Holliday "Ego is the enemy" talk at Google](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug414e-PCn4)
    * [Ego is the enemy](https://www.amazon.com/Ego-Enemy-Ryan-Holiday/dp/1591847818) book
    * Main takeways:
        * We're all in 1 of 3 phases in life: aspiration, success, failure. In these phases, it is important to recognize where and when ego manifests and reduce its negative impact 
            * Side: how to systematically recognize? 
        * "Don't tell yourself a story": narrative that others paint for you or you paint yourself tends to overpower your ability to objectively judge reality
            * **Don't look at past events in terms of what they say about you as a person; take the right lessons from them** 
        * "I never look back, except to find out about mistakes... I only see danger in thinking back about things you are proud of." quote by Elisabeth Noelle-Neumann

# ML/Data Science
* [Illustrated proof of CAP theorem](https://mwhittaker.github.io/blog/an_illustrated_proof_of_the_cap_theorem/)
  * Defs:
      * **Consistent**: a read operation must return the result of the latest completed write operation
      * **Available**: every request received by a non-failing node must result in a response
      * **Partition tolerant**: messages between nodes in the system may be delayed or lost, i.e communication between nodes can be unreliable
  * Important to note: this is oversimplifying CAP - the defs are loose and the "proof" only helps with intuitive high-level understanding; more rigorous treament is presented in this [paper](https://groups.csail.mit.edu/tds/papers/Gilbert/Brewer2.pdf)
