*Weeks 05/27 - 06/02*

Missed a few weeks oops

# News
* [Melinda Gates' new book](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2019/04/28/717438397/melinda-gates-on-marriage-parenting-and-why-she-made-bill-drive-the-kids-to-scho) on women empowerment as means to lift up society
  * She founded [Pivotal Labs](www.pivotalventures.org) focused on investing in orgs/indivs around social progress (esp. with regards to women's life) in US

# Op-eds
* [Don't try to be an influencer. Try to be a nerd instead](https://chibicode.com/posts/don-t-try-to-be-an-influencer-try-to-be-a-nerd-instead-don-t-try-to-maximize-your-impact-try-to-maximize-your-interest-instead/)
    * [Being a nerd pays off](https://twitter.com/codinghorror/status/852311991981035520/)
    * Being an influencer is a bad metric for self-worth; some people will never capture another people's needs or attention; being a nerd is always a winning strategy

* [Difference between workaholics and high performers](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20140625132650-4398055-high-performers-vs-workaholics-7-subtle-differences/)
    * Basically
        * **A high performer works hard in healthy sustainable ways and feels happy and inspired.**
        * **A workaholic works hard in unhealthy unsustainable ways and feels unhappy and burned out.**
    * In order to be a high performer
        * Focus on doing business (i.e. perform actions driven by results e.g. create tangible/relevant goals, form strategies/plans, follow through) as opposed to filling up time with busy work (i.e. reading/responding to emails right away instead of batching this appropriately)
        * Have a clear definition of success (seek to improve in areas that matter but know when to stop being a perfectionist)
        * Create own feedback loop instead of relying on external validation from boss, coworkers and clients
        * Be proactive/intentional with time and work (2-3 hours of deep undistracted work - no social media, preferably no disruptive emails/phone calls/meetings)
        * Focus on effort, compare against their best self instead of focusing on income/outcome and comparison against others

# ML/Data Science
* [Andrej Karpathy's blog on training neural networks](http://karpathy.github.io/2019/04/25/recipe/)
    * Separate [blog post]({{< ref "/post/things-to-consider-when-designing-and-tuning-neural-networks.md" >}}) on this topic

* [Illustrated proof of CAP theorem](https://mwhittaker.github.io/blog/an_illustrated_proof_of_the_cap_theorem/)
  * Defs:
      * **Consistent**: a read operation must return the result of the latest completed write operation
      * **Available**: every request received by a non-failing node must result in a response
      * **Partition tolerant**: messages between nodes in the system may be delayed or lost, i.e communication between nodes can be unreliable
  * Important to note: this is oversimplifying CAP - the defs are loose and the "proof" only helps with intuitive high-level understanding; more rigorous treament is presented in this [paper](https://groups.csail.mit.edu/tds/papers/Gilbert/Brewer2.pdf)

* [Computational Linear Algebra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iGzBMboA0I&list=PLtmWHNX-gukIc92m1K0P6bIOnZb-mg0hY&index=2&t=0s) by fast.ai (I plan to complete these when I'm done with Coursera Deep Learning Specialization)


# What I am working on
* Coursera: [deeplearning.ai](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) courses (5 courses)

* Technical blog posts:

* Recreational reading: Done with [Pachinko](https://www.amazon.com/Pachinko-National-Book-Award-Finalist/dp/1455563935/). Good enjoyable read: 4/5 stars.
  * Working on Cal Newport's [Deep Work](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Work-Focused-Success-Distracted/dp/1455586692)
  * 23% read
