# Big ideas
* [Habits vs Goals](https://fs.blog/2017/06/habits-vs-goals/)
  * TLDR: goal setting and achieving is good mindset to adopt but creating and maintaining long-term habits is more sustainable

* [TEDx: How drawing helps you think](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqlTSCvP-Z0)
  * We tend to draw what we know not what we see. Trick to combat this: instead of drawing the object, focus on the spaces betweent the object
  * Drawings don't have to be art; if they help us to think and connect with others, they are good enough
  * [Drawing exercises for beginners](https://medium.com/personal-growth/a-quick-beginners-guide-to-drawing-58213877715e)

* [Today's influencers = tomorrow's politicians?](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/16/technology/vidcon-social-media-influencers.html)
  * Despite my skepticism of influencer lifestyle compared to "nerd" lifestyle (mentioned in [last week's digest]({{< ref "/post/weekly-digest-3.md" >}})), it seems it does have its benefits
      * ‚ÄúThe way to think of influencers or creators is as entrepreneurs... These people are setting up businesses, hiring staff, managing budgets. These are massively transferable skills.‚Äù
  * Different strokes for different folks ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
